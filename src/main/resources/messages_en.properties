about.title=About
about.story1=MiXiT is a beautiful story began in 2011. 2019 will be the 9th edition already, and one of its first principles "to have an accessible conference to everyone" is always our agenda.
about.story2=Even if this conference has been created by Lyon Java User Group and the Club Agile Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes, you will not hear only about Agile and Java. Our goal is to not only have talks about the development in the broad sense, but also about management, project, entrepreneurship, desktop development, mobile phone and web, design...
about.story3=Like each year, we are proud to welcome you for some expert sessions, games and meetings. Entrepreneurs, project managers, developers, designers, you will find ideas for your project! Talks are given in French and in English.

Then <b>each speaker will have 30 seconds (timeboxed) to introduce her/his talk/workshop</b> (Speaker name, session name, room and schedule, key ideas) in English or French (there's no introduction for random talks to keep the surprise).

accessibility.title=Accessibility
accessibility.part1.title=An accessible conference
accessibility.part1.lead=From the beginning, MiXiT always has been accessible for people with motor disabilities, also we always reserve seats in the conference rooms if it is asked.
accessibility.part1.p1=Our event offer transcription for all the conferences (for both French and English ones) for deaf and hearing-impaired people. We also offer free tickets for those who are interested in exchange for a feedback allowing us to be better.
accessibility.part1.p2=If you want a place, send us an email at <b>contact@mixitconf.org</b>, we will respond as fast as possible and we will give you all the informations needed.
accessibility.part1.p3=We also booked a specific room for breastfeeding allowing people with children to come to the conference and have a quiet, intimate place.
accessibility.part2.title=History
accessibility.part2.lead=Historically, MiXiT was created with the value of accessibility. At first it was through financial accessibility with a price for two days far lower than other conferences that size.
accessibility.part2.p1=MiXiT has always be hosted in places accessible for motor disabilities people.
accessibility.part2.p2=In 2017, we began to book specific places for breastfeeding because we've encountered many people with young children who can't come to conferences because they haven't place with enough intimacy. This same year, we began our accessibility approach for hearing impaired people.
accessibility.part2.p3=After an initiative to survey our deaf and hearing-impaired contacts, we choose to begin with transcription of our conference. Our historical partner is <a href="http://www.scribovox.ovh/>Scribovox</a> which gives us a semi-automatic solution corrected by our volunteers. This first step helped us to test our capacity to offer this service in one conference room and helped <a href="http://www.scribovox.ovh/>Scribovox</a> to test its solution in an event like ours.
accessibility.part2.p4=In 2018, we created accessibility sponsoring tickets in order to finance the service <a href="http://www.systemerisp.com/" target="blank">Systeme RISP</a>. At this moment, we had 2 of 4 rooms equipped with accessibility solution.
accessibility.part2.p5=For the 2019 edition, we decided to equip all our conference rooms (4 rooms): 2 with <a href="http://www.systemerisp.com/" target="blank">Systeme RISP</a> and 2 with <a href="http://www.scribovox.ovh/>Scribovox</a>. Also, Scribovox allows us to transcribe English speaking conferences.
accessibility.part3.title=Future
accessibility.part3.lead=For the next editions, we hope we will able to offer sign language and other way to translate the conference and create services for blind and low vision people.
accessibility.part3.p1=Despite these services, it is still difficult for us to reach the targetted audience and this is why we have 15 free tickets to offer in exchange for a feedback.
accessibility.part3.p2=These tickets can be booked, outside of our usual ticketing process, just by sending us an email.
accessibility.part3.p3=If you are interested, send us an email to contact@mixitconf.org and we will answer as quick as possible and give you all the information needed.

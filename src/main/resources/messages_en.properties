about.title=About
about.story1=MiXiT is a beautiful story began in 2011 and born from the collaboration of the Lyon Java User Group and the Club Agile Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes. 2017 will be the 7th edition already, and one of its first principles "to have an accessible conference to everyone" is always our agenda.
about.story2=Even if this conference has been created by Lyon JUG and CARA, you will not hear only about Agile and Java. Our goal is to not only have talks about the development in the broad sense, but also about management, project, entrepreneurship, desktop development, mobile phone and web, design...
about.story3=Like each year, we are proud to welcome you for some expert sessions, games and meetings. Entrepreneurs, project managers, developers, designers, you will find ideas for your project! Talks are given in French and in English.

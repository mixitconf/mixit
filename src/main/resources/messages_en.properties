And that will be the occasion for us to celebrate our 10th edition in person, so you can expect some surprises! (we don't forget the 2021 online edition and its handful of selected speakers, but the team is not ready to endure the vagaries of connections and streaming tools again).

ticketing.description.why=Why do you need to pre-register ?
ticketing.description.intro=We know that it has become difficult to acquire the precious pass that opens the gates of this conference. Each year more and more attendees would like to join, and we are extremely thankful for that, but as a result not everyone can get a ticket. This year, as we did previously, no need for you to be stressed out, we are opening a pre-register step for everybody for <b>one month (until March, 31, midnight)</b>. 
ticketing.description.how=Then, we are going to do what every conference overwhelmed by its own popularity does (Google IO, Apple WWDC, NgConf, and... MiXiT): we are going to distribute the tickets among those who pre-registered with a good old random(). The lucky ones (most of you) will receive a link to buy their ticket. The less lucky ones will be able to catch up with the session recordings less than a week after the conference.
ticketing.description.hack=I already see some of you thinking about registering several times with their different email addresses, but we will take a close look, and <b>the ones who get caught will be excluded from the process.</b> If you want to check your subscription, you can log in on our website with the same email address used for pre-registering step. You can see on your profile page the state of your pre-registration.
ticketing.description.plus=One last thing: to ensure fairness among everybody, if you don't want to use your link to buy a ticket, we will give it to someone else. We won't authorize a transfer: the buyer of the ticket must have the same email used for the pre-registering step.

login.title=Login
login.action.signin=Log in
login.action.signin.description=Fill your email and click on the Sign in button to receive a connnection token. If you already have a token use the second button. If it's your first connexion, you will have to fill your firstname and lastname. If you try your chance on our ticket lottery, use the same email adress to see your lottery status.

Then <b>each speaker will have 30 seconds (timeboxed) to introduce her/his talk/workshop</b> (Speaker name, session name, room and schedule, key ideas) in English or French (there's no introduction for random talks to keep the surprise).

accessibility.title=Accessibility
accessibility.part1.title=An accessible conference
accessibility.part1.lead=From the beginning, MiXiT always has been accessible for people with motor disabilities, also we always reserve seats in the conference rooms if it is asked.
accessibility.part1.p1=Our event offer transcription for all the conferences (for both French and English ones) for deaf and hearing-impaired people. We also offer free tickets for those who are interested in exchange for a feedback allowing us to be better.
accessibility.part1.p2=If you want a place, send us an email at <b>contact@mixitconf.org</b>, we will respond as fast as possible and we will give you all the informations needed.
accessibility.part1.p3=We also booked a specific room for breastfeeding allowing people with children to come to the conference and have a quiet, intimate place.
accessibility.part2.title=History
accessibility.part2.lead=Historically, MiXiT was created with the value of accessibility. At first it was through financial accessibility with a price for two days far lower than other conferences that size.
accessibility.part2.p1=MiXiT has always be hosted in places accessible for motor disabilities people.
accessibility.part2.p2=In 2017, we began to book specific places for breastfeeding because we've encountered many people with young children who can't come to conferences because they haven't place with enough intimacy. This same year, we began our accessibility approach for hearing impaired people.
accessibility.part2.p3=After an initiative to survey our deaf and hearing-impaired contacts, we choose to begin with transcription of our conference. Our historical partner is <a href="http://www.scribovox.ovh/>Scribovox</a> which gives us a semi-automatic solution corrected by our volunteers. This first step helped us to test our capacity to offer this service in one conference room and helped <a href="http://www.scribovox.ovh/>Scribovox</a> to test its solution in an event like ours.
accessibility.part2.p4=In 2018, we created accessibility sponsoring tickets in order to finance the service <a href="http://www.systemerisp.com/" target="blank">Systeme RISP</a>. At this moment, we had 2 of 4 rooms equipped with accessibility solution.
accessibility.part2.p5=For the 2019 edition, we decided to equip all our conference rooms (4 rooms): 2 with <a href="http://www.systemerisp.com/" target="blank">Systeme RISP</a> and 2 with <a href="http://www.scribovox.ovh/>Scribovox</a>. Also, Scribovox allows us to transcribe English speaking conferences.
accessibility.part3.title=Future
accessibility.part3.lead=For the next editions, we hope we will able to offer sign language and other way to translate the conference and create services for blind and low vision people.
accessibility.part3.p1=Despite these services, it is still difficult for us to reach the targetted audience and this is why we have 15 free tickets to offer in exchange for a feedback.
accessibility.part3.p2=These tickets can be booked, outside of our usual ticketing process, just by sending us an email.
accessibility.part3.p3=If you are interested, send us an email to contact@mixitconf.org and we will answer as quick as possible and give you all the information needed.
